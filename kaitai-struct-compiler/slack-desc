kaitai-struct-compiler: Kaitai Struct, declarative markup language to describe various binary
kaitai-struct-compiler: data structures â€” binary file formats, network stream packets, etc.
kaitai-struct-compiler:
kaitai-struct-compiler: The basic idea of Kaitai Struct is that a particular format can be
kaitai-struct-compiler: described using Kaitai Struct language (in a .ksy file), which then
kaitai-struct-compiler: can be compiled using ksc into source files in one of the supported
kaitai-struct-compiler: programming languages. These modules will include a generated code
kaitai-struct-compiler: for a parser that can read described data structure from a
kaitai-struct-compiler: file / stream and provide access to its contents in a nice,
kaitai-struct-compiler: easy-to-comprehend API.
